# MRN-Portfolio
Portfolio Overview
Welcome to my portfolio, showcasing a comprehensive collection of my academic, professional, and personal projects. These works demonstrate my expertise and proficiency in using R, Python, and SQL to solve complex problems, analyze data, and create innovative solutions. Each project highlights my ability to apply theoretical knowledge to practical applications, delivering impactful results across various domains.

R
Conducted comprehensive statistical analyses on diverse datasets, uncovering trends and insights to support data-driven decision-making. Created compelling visualizations using libraries like ggplot2 to present complex data clearly, facilitating better understanding and communication.

Python
Leveraged Python for data engineering, analysis, and modeling. Built and managed data pipelines to ensure seamless extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) processes, delivering clean and reliable datasets for analysis. Conducted in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) using libraries such as Pandas and NumPy to uncover meaningful insights. Applied machine learning techniques, including linear and logistic regression, to solve predictive problems and support decision-making. Created detailed visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn to communicate findings effectively to stakeholders.

SQL
Created and managed databases to support data storage and analysis needs. Wrote SQL queries to efficiently extract, manipulate, and analyze data from various sources, ensuring accuracy and consistency. Integrated and combined datasets from multiple sources to uncover insights and support decision-making.
